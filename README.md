# üíÖ Style is Everything  
Clean Code, Beautiful Collaboration, and the AI Reviewer Era  
LWT Workshop 2025 ‚Äî Hope Watson

---

## üß∞ Materials You'll Need - Prerequisites 

**Before you begin, make sure you have**:
- [ ] GitHub account  
- [ ] Claude API key 
- [ ] Local IDE (VSCode recommended)  
- [ ] Ability to install software locally (DuckDB, dbt, SQLFluff)  

üí° **Tips**:
- Use a personal account to avoid access/permission issues.  
- Setup will run inside a `venv`, which you can delete afterward.  
- **The AI reviewer step costs ~$0.15 in Claude tokens**.

## üèÅ Workshop Goals
By the end of this workshop, you will:
1. Learn **rules and AI-driven patterns** to clean up codebases.  
2. Improve your **code review process** (for both newbies and veterans).    
3. Explore how to use **AI as a reviewer**, not just a generator.  
4. Build confidence in **collaboration workflows** with CI/CD.

---

## ‚úÖ 0. Addressing Prerequisites
 - Ensure you are able to clone a github repository using **SSH**. 
    - It is best to use SSH since we will be making changes to the repository.  
    - If you don't have a `.ssh` already setup you will need to do that. 
 - You will need a Claude API key.  
   - At the time of writing, the Claude API requires separate credits from the Pro subscription. 
   - Our workflow will cost approximately $0.15.  
   - To iterate on the pipeline I suggest $1.00 of API credits. 
 - The ability to install software. 
    - Many work computers do not allow downloads of software that are not from a trusted software center. For this reason I recommend using personal accounts for this workshop where possible. 
    - All software is installed in a venv that can be easily deleted following the workshop. 


## ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Setup
### A. Cloning repository to local 
1. Open VSCode and go to **Terminal** -> **New Terminal**. 
2. Navigate to a directory you want to clone the git repository (repo) into. 
    - For your home directory use `cd ~`. 
3. Clone the workshop repository: 
    ```bash 
    git clone git@github.com:HopeMWatson/lwt-style-is-everything.git code-walkthrough-lwt-style-is-everything
    cd code-walkthrough-lwt-style-is-everything
    ```

We now have our local repo. 

--- 
### B. Remote GitHub repository setup 
We need to run our actions from GitHub which means we need to create a remote version of the repository. 
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and make sure you are logged in.
2. Navigate to **Repositories** and create a new repo **New**. 
3. Name the repo `code-walkthrough-lwt-style-is-everything` and **Create repository**.  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Before you get click happy don't use the code github suggests for an existing repo.  
> This is because we are working from a *cloned repo*.

We have now created a remote repository. In our next step we need to link our local clone to remote. 

---
### C. Link local and remote repos
1. Make sure you are in your project directory:  
    ```bash 
    cd code-walkthrough-lwt-style-is-everything 
    ```
2. Set the remote so we link our local and remote.  
    ```bash 
    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:HopeMWatson/code-walkthrough-lwt-style-is-everything.git  

    git push -u origin main
    ```
3. Head back to your repo on GitHub and refresh the webpage.  
Notice the entire project has been brought in and pushed to our remote repo!  
<br>

While we are still on GitHub let's get the Claude GitHub app installed. 

---

### D. Install Claude GitHub app 
The Claude GitHub app allows us to run Claude Code actions from your GitHub Pull Requests.  
If you already have it installed you are good to go, otherwise install the app using the next step. 
1. Navigate to Claude GitHub app, which can be found here https://github.com/apps/claude. 
2. **Install** and select user (if you have multiple users). 
3. Decide if you are okay with Claude app to work across *All repositories* or *Only select repositories*. I chose *All repositories*. 
4. **Install & Authorize**. 

---

### E. Activate local venv 
1. Navigate back to **VSCode**. 
2. Create virtual environment (venv) by running the following command in the terminal:  
    ```bash 
    bash setup-workshop.sh
    ```  
    Give the venv script time to complete (about a minute). 

3. Activate the venv
    ```bash
    source activate.sh
    ``` 

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 2. Run local data pipeline 
1. Install dbt project dependencies by executing:
    ```bash 
    dbt deps
    ``` 
2. Now execute the *entire pipeline* including building tables, views, and tests: 
    ```bash 
    dbt build 
    ```
    After running our `dbt build` you should see a file `workshop.duckdb` that was created.  
    This is an entire database in a file ‚Äî duckdb is very cool; check it out at [duckdb.org](https://duckdb.org/)

3. Let's do some exploratory data analysis on what we just built using duckdb.  
To boot up the duckdb CLI on our database execute `duckdb workshop.duckdb` in the command line. 
4. See what commands are available to us type `.help` in the command line. 
5. Looks like we have some interesting commands such as `.tables`.  
    - Let's use `.tables` to see the tables we built as part of our `dbt build`. <br>
    - Write `.tables` in the command line and enter. 
6. I'm interested in our `orders` table, let's take a closer look, type:  
    `select * from orders;` in the command line. 
7. Investigate one or two more tables on your own using the duckdb CLI.  
You can try out different SQL commands while in the duckdb CLI.  
For example: `describe orders;`.  
8. To quit the duckdb CLI write `.quit` in the command line. 

That brings us back to our directory. Now is a good time to take a look our project and pipelines. 

## üìñ 3. Read action code and learn its functions
1. Open `.github/workflows`.
2. You see the workflows and the orchestrator file (more on this below).  
3. Open up each of the actions and read over what they are doing and how they function.  
   - The PR size workflow, `pr-size-check`, ensures we do not add too many new files or new lines of code in a single PR.  
   - The file naming convention, `file-naming-conventions-check`, ensures we name files according to a prefix rule.
   - The linting workflow, `linting`, enforces the rules we've specified in our `.sqlfluff` file.  
        - Open up the `.sqlfluff` file to look at the rulesets. 
        - This determines how our sql should be styled. üíÖ  
   - Our `dbt-ci-job` workflow builds only what has been modified and ensures our SQL is valid to build the tables and views. Additionally, it runs all the data test checks.  
   - AI reviewer, `pr_ai_reviewer`, summons claude via API key to review and comment on the PR.  
   - Importantly, we want to specify the **order** in which these workflows run. We use, `pr-pipeline-orchestrator`, to do this. For example, if our linting fails we want that to happen before we have to pay to use any tokens for Claude.
   - Finally, `main-state` is a workflow we use to create mock production artifacts and data to compare against in our `dbt-ci-job`. 

üß† There is a lot going on here and this the heart of this workshop, so take time to understand on your own time too! 

## ü§ñ 4. Claude reviewer variable and Claude API key
### A. Set GitHub variable for AI reviewer
You saw in our `pr-pipeline-orchestrator` pipeline we use a variable `vars.ENABLE_AI_REVIEW == 'true'` as a switch to decide if we want the AI reviewer pipeline on.  
This can be helpful to control costs if you don't want the AI review pipeline running on every PR. 

1. In your GitHub repo go to **Settings**.
2. **Secrets and variables** -> **Actions** -> **Variables**.
3. **New repository variable**.
4. **Name** the variable `ENABLE_AI_REVIEW`, set the **Value** to `true`, and **Add variable**.  
Our variable is now set to allow our AI Reviewer pipeline to run. 

---
### B. Claude API key
We need to create a Claude API key to call Claude into our review process.  
To do this we need to pass our API key into GitHub as a secret.

1. Go to [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard) and click **Get API Key**. 
2. **Create Key**, select your workspace, and name your key.  
I named mine `code-walkthrough-lwt`. 
3. **Copy Key**.  
Note: In a production setting you may place your API key into another secrets manager software like AWS secrets manager or 1Password. 
4. Go back to GitHub in your repo to **Settings**.
5. **Secrets and variables** -> **Actions** -> **New repository secret**.
6. **Name** the secret `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, copy in your **Secret**, and **Add secret**. 

Now we have a way to securely call Claude into our GitHub Actions. 

### C. Generate dbt artifacts for "Production" deferral CI job
In this step we are simulating a production run to generate data and metadata for our CI job to defer to. 
Think of it as creating the baseline state for both the code and data that CI defers to! 
- I admit, state and tracking state can be a very complex topic outside the scope of this workshop. 
- What I will say is take time to think about how often the state of code changes. When you change the logic of your code it effects the data too.  You might then want your data pipeline to run again to reflect those changes. 

1. In our `code-walkthrough-lwt-style-is-everything` repo go to **Actions**. 
2. Select the `main-state-build` action. 
3. Click **Run workflow** to manually trigger the workflow off the `main` branch. 
4. The workflow will kick off and take about a minute to complete.  
    - üìù Note: in the step `Full build on main` we run all 47 seeds, models, and tests. Keep this number in mind when we run the CI pipeline.
5. After the workflow is complete look at **Artifacts**. Both `dbt-state-artifacts` and `workshop.db` were created.  
    - What are these artifacts doing? 
    - Respectively `dbt-state-artifacts` is tracking the state of our code and `workshop.db` is tracking the state of our data. 

ü§î Why did we do this?  
Now when we run a CI job, we only have to create what we changed and downstream impacts of the change instead of rerunning everything.  


## 5. Trigger `pr-pipeline-orchestrator` GitHub workflow for the first time 
1. Make a working branch:  
    ``` 
    git checkout -b working-branch
    ```  
    Double check you are in your working branch:  
    ```
    git branch
    ```
2. Open the SQL file `locations.sql` and replace the `*` with the actual column names.  
    ```sql
    location_id,
    location_name, 
    tax_rate
    ```
    Please leave out `opened_date` on purpose! 

3. Save the change in the VSCode.
4. Check your git status using `git status` to ensure the modification we made was tracked. 
5. Add and commit the change:
    ```
    git commit -am "explicit naming of locations columns" 
    ```
6. Push your changes using 
    ```
    git push --set-upstream origin working-branch
    ```

    - üí≠ Before we move on, can you guess which workflow of the four is most likely to fail: pr size, file naming, linting, or dbt build? Ignore the AI reviewer pipeline for now. 

7. Navigate to GitHub and **Pull requests** -> **New pull request** and select `working-branch` and **Create pull request** against `main`. 
8. Select **Create pull request** again. 
9. You will now see our `PR Pipeline Orchestrator` kickoff. 



## üßê 6. Investigating the PR Pipeline Orchestrator Results.

1. First up is our PR size check, how did we do:
    ```
    üîç Checking PR size limits...
    üìÅ Files changed: 1
    üìä Lines added: 5
    üìä Lines removed: 1
    üìä Net lines: 4
    ‚úÖ PR size is within limits
    üìã Summary:
    - Files: 1/100
    - Lines added: 5/10,000
    ```
    We definitely passed this! üí™

2. How about File naming conventions:
    ``` 
    ‚úÖ All model and YAML filenames follow conventions.
    ```
    Looks great! 

3. Linting?   
Oof ‚Äî not so much. üò¨ This step of our pipeline failed. We have some trailing whitespace and ugly sql. We failed this step, but since we're allowed `continue on error` it did not halt our entire pipeline! 

4. How about our dbt CI build?  
Firstly, our CI pass checks which means if we did promote this change to production it would not break out pipelines.  
Additionally, note how only the changed model was run instead of all 47 models. Since `locations` has no downstream impact on another model, it is the only one run. 
    ```
    1 of 1 START sql table model main.locations .................................... [RUN]
    1 of 1 OK created sql table model main.locations ............................... [OK in 0.11s]
    ```

5. Finally, what is our AI review telling us? 
Claude took a minute and $0.15 to review all of our code.
    - Go to **Pull requests** and see where Claude has added comments to our PR and code!
    - Claude flagged a *Potential Data Loss* by since we excluded the column `opened_date` and asks us to add it back in or add a comment in the SQL as to explicitly why we are leaving it out. 
    - Claude is also praising us for using explicit column naming instead of implicit for clarity! üòé

Claude caught an issue that could happen in the real world ‚Äî a developer accidentally omits a column that impacts the schema of a table used for reporting and breaks it. 

GitHub also sent us an email üìß with our Claude summary ‚Äî I think this is a nice touch, but if you find it noisy you can disable the emails. 

## 7. (Optional) Turn off `ENABLE_AI_REVIEW` 
We don't need our AI Reviewer step on to clean up our SQL styling to fix our linting step. 
This step is optional, if you leave the AI Reviewer turned on it will cost another ~$0.15 in credits. 

1. Head back to your GitHub repo settings and variable. 
2. Change the value of `ENABLE_AI_REVIEW` to `false`.
3. This will prompt verification code sent to your email.  
Enter the code to verify changing the variable. 

Our AI Reviewer step will now be skipped! 

## 8. Fixing linting errors locally and adding `opened_date`
We have to fix our ugly code to get our pipeline linting succeeding! 

1. Go back VSCode to your working branch and ensure you have a clean branch (ensure it's up to date):
    ```
    git checkout working-branch
    ```
    ```
     git status
     ```
     
2. Let's lint our entire project:
    ```
    sqlfluff lint . 
    ```
    We should see the warnings that were flagged during `linting` workflow run. 
3. Now we can fix all the warnings by running:
    ```
    sqlfluff fix .
    ```
    You will see that your files have been modified `M` by the linter. 
4. To confirm we will have no violations let's lint again:
    ```
    sqlfluff lint . 
    ```
5. Open the SQL file `locations.sql` and add a trailing comma after `tax_rate` and add `opened_date` (no trailing comma); it should look like this:
    ```
    location_id,
    location_name, 
    tax_rate,
    opened_date
    ```

6. We now need to check our git status and commit our changes after cleaning up the styling.
    ```
    git status
    ``` 
    ```
    git commit -am "linting project to maintain style guide according to .sqlfluff and adding opened_date to locations model"
    ```
7. Push the change:
    ``` 
    git push
    ``` 
8. Navigate back to GitHub and see our `PR Pipeline Orchestrator` kicked off again with our new commit. 

Our linting step now passes! 

## 9. Recapping, Next Steps, and Cleanup
### Recapping
We just proved that **style really *is* everything** ‚Äî from linted SQL to orchestrated pipelines to beautifully reviewed PRs. üíÖ  

You watched **structure, clarity, and automation** come together like a well-styled outfit: every step intentional, nothing out of place.üíÉ   

Claude didn‚Äôt just review our code ‚Äî it was our **personal code stylist**. ü§ñ  

Now our code is so beautiful, even your coworkers can‚Äôt side-eye üëÄ it ‚Äî they‚Äôll just quietly copy your style. üòâ  

Because in the end, **imitation is the sincerest form of flattery**, especially when your SQL is serving both **looks *and* logic**. üî•  


### Next Steps 
Here are a few next steps to implement this into your own codebase:
1. Play around with the styling rules in `.sqlfluff` or a linter for whatever language your codebase is written in. 
2. Apply more naming convention checks. Consider regex if you have complicated naming structures. 
3. Start tuning the inputs into `pr-ai-reviewer`.  
For example you can tune and select:
    - different anthropic models (i.e. `sonnet` vs. `haiku`), 
    - disable prompt caching (`DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING: "1"`), and 
    - the maximum turns (i.e.`--max-turns 6`). 
### Cleanup 
Now for the cleanup and teardown. 
If you don't want this repository on your computer or GitHub following the workshop here are the instructions. 

#### Local cleanup 
1. For local cleanup navigate the the directory in your terminal: 
    ```bash 
    cd code-walkthrough-lwt-style-is-everything
    ```
2. **Only run this if you want the entire repository deleted**
    ```bash 
    rm -rf code-walkthrough-lwt-style-is-everything
    ```    
#### Remote GitHub cleanup 
1. Navigate to the **Settings** area of your repository.
2. Head on down to the end of the page to the **Danger Zone**
3. Select **Delete this repository**. 


# Contributing to this repository 
This is a workshop repository, so usually that means it is narrowly scoped and rarely iterated on by contributors.
However, I welcome feedback, suggestions, and opening issues! 

One aspect of this workshop I didn't have time to address is Windows friendly instructions; it is written for MacOS and linux. 
If you want to make this workshop Windows friendly please feel free to contribute.  
I also would have combined the sqlfluff and dbt CI build steps if more time had allowed for pipeline efficiency. 

# Acknowledgements 
Firstly, to my partner Nicole, that both encourages and tolerates (in that order) my work and my endless learning (with a cupful of perfectionism).  

Secondly, I have to thank the dbt Labs teams since I'm building on prior art from the long lived jaffle shop. 
Special thank you to all the contributors there I've personally worked with over the years ‚Äî Winnie, Anders, and Benoit.
